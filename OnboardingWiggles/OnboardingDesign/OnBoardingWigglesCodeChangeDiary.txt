Cleanup Help layout & add blur with animation to show Help as modal
2020-05-30

Cleaned up folder structure from generation, moving Controllers up out of sub-folders
(this was a mistake in export settings)

ExpandedViewViewController.swift
- onHelpClosePressed change from push to modal present to show help

ShowHelpViewcontroller.xib
- adjusted TipBackground auto-layout to take up all of the view (expecting to be nested in small view)
- changed font of More... button to standard Label font
- renamed main label TipLabel & set contraints so takes up most of TipBackground, sized to leave room for the button but expanding on different width screens
- TipMsg set InteractionEnabled

ShowHelpViewcontroller.swift
- customTransitioningDelegate added
- init overrides added to call configureTransition
- configureTransition added
- setupComponents - remove the generated code setting a border color as the dimming background blur is a much better effect
- onMoreButtonPressed - put a testing hack in to dismiss the controller

PresentationController.swift
- added to do custom modal embedding with transition animation
- also contains little helper class TransitioningDelegate
